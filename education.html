    <h2>Work Experience</h2>

    <h3>Pioneer</h3>
    <p>Detasseler, 2013 - 2014 (Seasonal) <br>
    As a young teenager, I would spend my summers detasseling corn. Working the fields built my work ethic and taught me the value of money.</p>

    <h3>McDonald's</h3>
    <p>Crew Member, 2015 - 2017 <br>
    As soon as I hit the age of 16, I picked up a part-time job at my local McDonald's. Here, I learned how to thrive in a fast-paced work environment that required
    teamwork, coordination and customer service skills in order to provide the expectation of quality that customers deserved.</p>

    <h3>United States Marine Corps</h3>
    <p>Administrative Non-Commissioned Officer, 2018 - 2022. <br>
    I joined the Marine Corps on January 7, 2018. It was more than just a job: it was a lifestyle. This period of my work history saw most of my development occur, as a person,
    as a worker and then as a supervisor. I worked my way up the totem pole from a Private (E-1) all the way to a Corporal (E-4). </p>

    <h3>Lowe's Home Improvement</h3>
    <p>Pro Desk Customer Serivce Associate, Summer 2022. <br>
    Shortly after beginning my journey towards a Bachelor's in Computer Science here at UIS, I decided to pick up a job over the summer in order to supplement my income. I joined 
    the team at the Pro Service Desk, where we assisted contractor's/contracting companies with their needs. Having just left the Corps, it was a cakewalk to me. My work ethic made 
    me a welcome addition to the Pro Team, and I was able to learn quickly to compensate my lack of knowledge regarding general home improvement.</p>

    <h3>Illinois Department of Veteran's Affairs</h3>
    <p>VA Work/Study, 2022 - Present <br>
    In October 2022, I met my now supervisor Dan Wellman through a mutual contact of ours. He offered me a part time Work/Study I just couldn't refuse. I was given a flexible schedule,
    my own office and simple duties to complete. This was a position I couldn't refuse. Although it was too easy initially, I sought to do something that would use my skillset and 
    challenge me. What sprung from this was a months-long project for me: I was to overhaul their data storage and reporting system. That system, was Microsoft Excel. Yikes. I go 
    into further detail regarding my Access project below.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>

    <h3>Beardstown Jr./Sr. High School</h3>
    <p>2014 - 2017<br>
    I attended High School here and graduated as part of the Class of '17. Soon after, I was shipped off to recruit training.</p>

    <h3>University of Illinois at Springfield</h3>
    <p>2022 - Present <br>
    I am currently working towards my Bachelor's in Computer Science here at UIS.</p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>

    <h3>Chess</h3>
    <p>As of recently, I find myself becoming an avid Chess player. Although I have never had a penchant for strategy games, Chess managed to grab my attention. I play both online
    on Chess.com as well as in-person here at the local Springfield Chess Club from time to time.</p>

    <h3>Pathfinder Second Edition (Dungeons and Dragons variant)</h3>
    <p>Pathfinder is a hobby of mine. My groups of friends will sit down and run a session of Pathfinder to tell a story, fight bad guys and kill monsters. Although I am usually a player, 
    I also run my own Pathfinder campaign for others.</p>

    <h3>Weight Training</h3>
    <p>Weight training is something I've enjoyed doing for a long time. I frequent my local Planet Fitness and train there whenever my schedule permits.</p>

    <!-- This entire section is dedicated to listing my projects. The project is listed under the h3 element and any additional information is listed under the p element. -->
    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <h3>Control Logs Access Project</h3>
    <p>The team I worked for at IDVA was responsible for all of the facilities that offered training that could use Veteran benefits such as the Post 9/11 GI Bill. The types of training 
    were varied: it could be anything from an On the Job Apprenticeship to a Non-Certificate Degree. Needless to say, the number of facilities, and veterans, was significant.
    As part of my time at IDVA, I was tasked with overhauling our team's data storage and reporting. Before this project, they were using multiple spreadsheets as a database 
    and manually parsing data every quarter for their reporting. It was... not good, to say the least. <br>
    The Access database I created managed to achieve three things: <br>
    1. Simplified reporting down to the click of a button. <br>
    2. Provided a streamlined front-end for the users. <br>
    3. Integrated various reports into our own reporting. <br>
    This database has been in use for about a year now, and it's only managed to improve. I've had a few iterations to tweak the database as needed and added features that 
    were requested, such as additional, more complex, reporting. This database has become essential to the team.</p>

    <h3>Pathfinder Combat Simulator</h3>
    <p>In my off time, I decided to work on a personal project of mine. In Pathfinder Second Edition, there are various classes to choose from. You can pick any class from a Fighter to 
    a Rogue and so on. At some point, I asked myself: <br> "What class does the most damage?" <br> Although this was more of a fleeting thought than anything else, I found myself building 
    a Java project in order to answer that question. I built this project with the three action system of Pathfinder in mind: each character has three actions per turn to use. Although you 
    can use a single action to Strike, classes often provide varied ways to use your actions that can improve your damage. Due to the sheer amount of options each class has, I haven't 
    come up with a concrete, singular answer yet. This continues to be a work in progress. However, this project has led to better balancing of certain classes that struggle due to system 
    mechanics, such as the Swashbuckler and their Panache mechanic.</p>
