    <h2>Work Experience</h2>

    <h3>Pioneer</h3>
    <p class = "fancyBorder">Seasonal Detasseler<br>
    2013 & 2014<br>
    As a young teenager, I would spend my summers detasseling corn. Working the fields built my work ethic and taught me the value of money.</p>

    <h3>McDonald's</h3>
    <p class = "fancyBorder">Crew Member<br>
    June 2015 - July 2017 <br>
    As soon as I hit the age of 16, I picked up a part-time job at my local McDonald's. Here, I learned how to thrive in a fast-paced work environment that required
    teamwork, coordination and customer service skills in order to provide the expectation of quality that customers deserved.</p>

    <h3>United States Marine Corps</h3>
    <p class = "fancyBorder">Administrative Non-Commissioned Officer<br>
    January 2018 - January 2022. <br>
    I joined the Marine Corps on January 7, 2018. It was more than just a job: it was a lifestyle. This period of my work history saw most of my development occur, as a person,
    as a worker and then as a supervisor. I worked my way up the totem pole from a Private (E-1) all the way to a Corporal (E-4). </p>

    <h3>Lowe's Home Improvement</h3>
    <p class = "fancyBorder">Pro Desk Customer Serivce Associate<br>
    Summer 2022<br>
    Shortly after beginning my journey towards a Bachelor's in Computer Science here at UIS, I decided to pick up a job over the summer in order to supplement my income. I joined 
    the team at the Pro Service Desk, where we assisted contractor's/contracting companies with their needs. Having just left the Corps, it was a cakewalk to me. My work ethic made 
    me a welcome addition to the Pro Team, and I was able to learn quickly to compensate my lack of knowledge regarding general home improvement.</p>

    <h3>Illinois Department of Veteran's Affairs</h3>
    <p class = "fancyBorder">VA Work/Study<br>
    October 2022 - Present <br>
    In 2022, I met my now supervisor Dan Wellman through a mutual contact of ours. He offered me a part time Work/Study I just couldn't refuse. I was given a flexible schedule,
    my own office and simple duties to complete. This was a position I couldn't refuse. Although it was too easy initially, I sought to do something that would use my skillset and 
    challenge me. What sprung from this was a months-long project for me: I was to overhaul their data storage and reporting system. That system, was Microsoft Excel. Yikes. I go 
    into further detail regarding my Access project below.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>

    <h3>Beardstown Jr./Sr. High School</h3>
    <p class = "fancyBorder">High School Diploma<br>
    2014 - 2017<br>
    I attended High School here and graduated as part of the Class of '17. Soon after, I was shipped off to recruit training.</p>

    <h3>University of Illinois at Springfield</h3>
    <p class = "fancyBorder">Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science <br>
    2022 - 2024 <br>
    I completed my undergraduate studies here at UIS in December 2024.</p>
    
    <p class = "fancyBorder">Master's of Science in Computer Science <br>
    January 2024 - Present<br>
    I picked up where I left off and ventured forth towards my graduate studies. Given the wide range of flexibility offered for my graduate studies, I dabbled in Artificial Intellgence and Cybersecurity.</p>
