    <h2>Work Experience</h2>

    <h3>Pioneer</h3>
    <p class = "fancyBorder">Detasseler, 2013 - 2014 (Seasonal) <br>
    As a young teenager, I would spend my summers detasseling corn. Working the fields built my work ethic and taught me the value of money.</p>

    <h3>McDonald's</h3>
    <p class = "fancyBorder">Crew Member, 2015 - 2017 <br>
    As soon as I hit the age of 16, I picked up a part-time job at my local McDonald's. Here, I learned how to thrive in a fast-paced work environment that required
    teamwork, coordination and customer service skills in order to provide the expectation of quality that customers deserved.</p>

    <h3>United States Marine Corps</h3>
    <p class = "fancyBorder">Administrative Non-Commissioned Officer, 2018 - 2022. <br>
    I joined the Marine Corps on January 7, 2018. It was more than just a job: it was a lifestyle. This period of my work history saw most of my development occur, as a person,
    as a worker and then as a supervisor. I worked my way up the totem pole from a Private (E-1) all the way to a Corporal (E-4). </p>

    <h3>Lowe's Home Improvement</h3>
    <p class = "fancyBorder">Pro Desk Customer Serivce Associate, Summer 2022. <br>
    Shortly after beginning my journey towards a Bachelor's in Computer Science here at UIS, I decided to pick up a job over the summer in order to supplement my income. I joined 
    the team at the Pro Service Desk, where we assisted contractor's/contracting companies with their needs. Having just left the Corps, it was a cakewalk to me. My work ethic made 
    me a welcome addition to the Pro Team, and I was able to learn quickly to compensate my lack of knowledge regarding general home improvement.</p>

    <h3>Illinois Department of Veteran's Affairs</h3>
    <p class = "fancyBorder">VA Work/Study, 2022 - Present <br>
    In October 2022, I met my now supervisor Dan Wellman through a mutual contact of ours. He offered me a part time Work/Study I just couldn't refuse. I was given a flexible schedule,
    my own office and simple duties to complete. This was a position I couldn't refuse. Although it was too easy initially, I sought to do something that would use my skillset and 
    challenge me. What sprung from this was a months-long project for me: I was to overhaul their data storage and reporting system. That system, was Microsoft Excel. Yikes. I go 
    into further detail regarding my Access project below.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>

    <h3>Beardstown Jr./Sr. High School</h3>
    <p class = "fancyBorder">2014 - 2017<br>
    I attended High School here and graduated as part of the Class of '17. Soon after, I was shipped off to recruit training.</p>

    <h3>University of Illinois at Springfield</h3>
    <p class = "fancyBorder">2022 - Present <br>
    I am currently working towards my Bachelor's in Computer Science here at UIS.</p>
