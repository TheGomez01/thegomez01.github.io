    <h2>Interests</h2>

    <h3>Chess</h3>
    <p class = "fancyBorder">As of recently, I find myself becoming an avid Chess player. Although I have never had a penchant for strategy games, Chess managed to grab my attention. I play both online
    on Chess.com as well as in-person here at the local Springfield Chess Club from time to time.</p>

    <h3>Pathfinder Second Edition (Dungeons and Dragons variant)</h3>
    <p class = "fancyBorder">Pathfinder is a hobby of mine. My groups of friends will sit down and run a session of Pathfinder to tell a story, fight bad guys and kill monsters. Although I am usually a player,
    I also run my own Pathfinder campaign for others.</p>

    <h3>Weight Training</h3>
    <p class = "fancyBorder">Weight training is something I've enjoyed doing for a long time. I frequent my local Planet Fitness and train there whenever my schedule permits.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <h3>Control Logs Access Project</h3>
    <p class = "fancyBorder">The team I worked for at IDVA was responsible for all of the facilities that offered training that could use Veteran benefits such as the Post 9/11 GI Bill. The types of training
    were varied: it could be anything from an On the Job Apprenticeship to a Non-Certificate Degree. Needless to say, the number of facilities, and veterans, was significant.
    As part of my time at IDVA, I was tasked with overhauling our team's data storage and reporting. Before this project, they were using multiple spreadsheets as a database 
    and manually parsing data every quarter for their reporting. It was... not good, to say the least. <br>
    The Access database I created managed to achieve three things: <br>
    1. Simplified reporting down to the click of a button. <br>
    2. Provided a streamlined front-end for the users. <br>
    3. Integrated various reports into our own reporting. <br>
    This database has been in use for about a year now, and it's only managed to improve. I've had a few iterations to tweak the database as needed and added features that 
    were requested, such as additional, more complex, reporting. This database has become essential to the team.</p>

    <h3>Pathfinder Combat Simulator</h3>
    <p class = "fancyBorder">In my off time, I decided to work on a personal project of mine. In Pathfinder Second Edition, there are various classes to choose from. You can pick any class from a Fighter to
    a Rogue and so on. At some point, I asked myself: <br> "What class does the most damage?" <br> Although this was more of a fleeting thought than anything else, I found myself building 
    a Java project in order to answer that question. I built this project with the three action system of Pathfinder in mind: each character has three actions per turn to use. Although you 
    can use a single action to Strike, classes often provide varied ways to use your actions that can improve your damage. Due to the sheer amount of options each class has, I haven't 
    come up with a concrete, singular answer yet. This continues to be a work in progress. However, this project has led to better balancing of certain classes that struggle due to system 
    mechanics, such as the Swashbuckler and their Panache mechanic.</p>
