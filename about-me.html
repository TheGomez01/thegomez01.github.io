    <!-- This entire page is dedicated towards a semi-autobiography of myself. Each p element tackles a different subject. -->
    <p class = "fancyBorder">My name is Jesus Adrian Gomez. I am 25 years old and am a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Springfield. I am pursuing a Master's of Science in Computer Science. I was born in Rushvile, Illinois and grew up in the nearby town of Beardstown. Both of these towns are located an hour northwest of Springfield. As a young child, I
    had always displayed an affinity for technology. You could find me tinkering with technology in various ways, whether it was building a small, solar-powered robot with my 
    father or even as far as hacking my Wii, I found technology fascinating. I knew early on that tech was in my future, even if the skill floor was notably higher than other, non-STEM
    majors.</p>

    <p class = "fancyBorder rightText">My path to university was not "traditional" due to a singular factor: the Marine Corps. During my time in High School, I came across a Marine recruiter, Staff Sergeant (SSgt) Jose Gonzalez. SSgt Gonzalez,
    although a recruiter, was a role model to me in my younger years. I aspired to be like him, and as such enlisted into the United States Marine Corps right out of High School.
    I shipped out to Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, California on January 7th, 2018 and began a journey that would span the next four years of my life.</p>

    <p class="fancyBorder leftText">During my time in the Marine Corps, I managed to glean much wisdom from both the people I was surrounded by and the experiences the Corps gave me. A common saying in the
    Corps is: <a href="https://www.tecom.marines.mil/In-the-News/Stories/News-Article-Display/Article/527984/we-dont-promise-you-a-rose-garden/"> 
    "We Don't Promise You a Rose Garden"</a>, and it shows. Many of my experiences were trying times, whether I was hiking up a mountain known as The Reaper, training in the 
    field during Marine Combat Training, or learning the basics from the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program, I was constantly challenged. Not only physically, but mentally as well.
    Although my time in the military was challenging, it was equally rewarding. I managed to find myself in locations I never would have without the Corps. One month, I'd find 
    myself in sunny San Diego, California. Another month I could find myself in the sweltering summer heat of Columbia, South Carolina. Shortly after I was finished with the 
    training pipeline, I was sent to Iwakuni, Japan for two years to support the Corps' Postal Operations for servicemembers and their families who found themselves abroad. My 
    time in Japan allowed me to explore my interest in technology. We relied on an older Access database to track millions of pounds of prograde and retrograde mail, and I was
    able to meet the Marine who built it and glean some insight as to how it worked. Although my knowledge at the time was rudimentary, I managed to get a decent grasp on the basics, 
    such as tables, forms, queries and reports. This was also when I was first introduced to code, since Access uses Visual Basic for Applications.</p>

    <p class = "fancyBorder">I spent about two years about Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan. I was eventually given orders to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, San Diego, California.
    San Diego simply refused to let go of me. I picked up the rank of Corporal here and and finished up the last year and a half of my contract before the End of my Active Service.
    I returned to Illinois after the end of my contract, and chose to pursue my interest in Computer Science here at the University of Illinois at Springfield. During my time here,
    I was able to take part in a VA Work/Study here at the Illinois Department of Veteran's Affairs, where I was able to explore more practical applications of my knowledge.</p>
