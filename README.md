This was a personal project of mine I made when I took Intro to Web Design. It is meant to serve as a portfolio of mine.
Though most of the content here is passable, I've come to realize how little responsiveness exists here. The idea is to
amend that issue and then (potentially) offer to make a website for some small business in my local area, pro bono.
Experience must come from somewhere, that is as good a place as any.

Edit: It's going to need more work than I first expected. It's mid as hell right now.
